# Tree-Based Regression Algorithms
Tree-Based Regression Algorithms Used on 3D Data.
The main purpose of this assignment was to gain experience using tree-based methods to solve simple regression problems. In this assignment, I fit a Gradient-Boosted Regression Tree, a Random Forest, and a Decision Tree to a noisy 3D sinusoidal data set.
